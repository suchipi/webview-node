On Linux, you need to install GTK3 and GtkWebkit2.

Ubuntu users can run this command:
```
sudo apt-get install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
```

Everyone else should probably be able to figure it out.

If you're distributing a game on steam or something, you should include these libs with your binary, but idk how to do that, so you're on your own. Sorry.
